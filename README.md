# TODO APP (Laravel 8 + Vue 3)

Using Laravel v8 and using Vue.js v3 version, I developed my todo application using vuex ( State Management System ) and I frequently benefited from Laravel's Eloquent ORM Model architecture.

I took care of the development of this simply developed system using Modern Technologies and tried to use it :)

```terminal
$ npm run watch
```

then

```terminal
$ php artisan serve
```
